# 🏓 Electronic Table Tennis Scoreboard  

I wanted to address the constant problem of inconsistent table tennis scoring methods, often leading to arguments, score loss, or even just cheating.
With this project I was able to combine my interest in electronics, programming, and design to create a reliable solution for fair table tennis scorekeeping.
